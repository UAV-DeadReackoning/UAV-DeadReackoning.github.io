            <h2> Program Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are essential in various applications,
                including agriculture, disaster management, and military operations,
                where location integrity and situational awareness are critical.
                However, methods that rely on GPS signals face significant challenges in extreme
                conditions, such as signal unavailability (e.g., navigating crowded urban areas)
                and signal compromise (e.g., GPS spoofing attacks). This project addresses these
                challenges with data-driven approaches that minimize reliance on GPS information,
                ensuring UAV location integrity and awareness.

            <h2>Our Approach</h2>
            <p>
                This project investigates a trajectory-based analysis inspired by the nautical practice of
                “dead reckoning.” This method estimates the position of a moving object based on its movement
                data, including previous position, velocity, direction, and elapsed time. Our approach is thus
                data-driven, utilizing UAV movement updates to offer location integrity and awareness without
                solely relying on GPS information.

            <h2>Objectives</h2>
            <p>
                We aim to develop a cutting-edge deep analytics framework to provide
                UAV location checks and estimation to ensure its integrity and awareness using
                machine intelligence. Our project's key innovations include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Movement-based validation</strong> and estimation of current coordinates, even without GPS.</li>
                <li><strong>Architectural designs</strong>to analyze flight data sequences via trajectory-based analysis.</li>
                <li><strong>One-class learning </strong>to build deep sequence models focusing on normal flight data, addressing
                    the scarcity of abnormal data with inconsistent location information.</li>
                <li><strong>On-board inference </strong>transforming the deep sequence models into lightweight equivalents to effectively
                    support deep inference on UAVs with recourse-constrained AI engines. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Ultimately, this project provides a robust solution to existing GPS-based methods, ensuring reliable UAV operations in
                challenging environments.
