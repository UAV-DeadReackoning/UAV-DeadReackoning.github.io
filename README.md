# UAV Dead Reckoning Project Website

This repository hosts the **official GitHub Pages website** for the **UAV Dead Reckoning** research project.

**Live site:** https://uav-deadreackoning.github.io
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are widely used in applications such as agriculture, disaster response, surveillance, and autonomous navigation. 
Many UAV systems rely heavily on GPS for localization, which makes them vulnerable to signal unavailability and adversarial attacks such as GPS spoofing.

## Project overview
The UAV Dead Reckoning project investigates **trajectory-based, data-driven approaches** to ensure **location integrity and situational awareness**, even in GPS-denied or compromised environments. 
Inspired by the classical concept of *dead reckoning*, this work leverages UAV motion dynamics and deep sequence learning models to detect anomalies and estimate trustworthy location states.

## Research Focus
Key research themes include:
- Deep sequence learning for UAV trajectory modeling
- Pretrained temporal and transformer-based models
- Anomaly detection and integrity verification
- GPS-independent or GPS-resilient localization
- Lightweight inference for resource-constrained UAV platforms
