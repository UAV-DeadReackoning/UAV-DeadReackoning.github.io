Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are an integral part of agricultural systems, disaster response, surveillance, and autonomous navigation.
UAVs are primarily GPS-based systems that can suffer from loss of signal and adversarial techniques, such as GPS spoofing.

## Project overview
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are a common fact of life, deployed in various areas, including agriculture, crisis intervention, and military use, where precise location and knowledge of their surroundings are essential. In these challenging conditions, associated with signal limitations such as congested urban environments, serious challenges arise, including similar issues of signal compromise to those that occurred with GPS spoofing. This project aims to leverage more data-driven operations in UAVs and reduce dependence on GPS, potentially endangering the UAV’s integrity in different locations.

## Research Focus
Key research themes include:
- Deep sequence learning for UAV trajectory modeling
- Pretrained temporal and transformer-based models
- Anomaly detection and integrity verification
- GPS-independent or GPS-resilient localization
- Lightweight inference for resource-constrained UAV platforms
